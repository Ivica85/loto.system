The "lotto system" project is a classic example of a game of chance.
Registered users can add their valid credit cards, which they can use to purchase/replenish credit, and thus take randomly generated lotto tickets.
The drawing is once a week, and if the competitor has more than 3 hits, he can get a part of the prize.
